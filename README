This program is designed to transfer files from the raspberry pi on the plane (client), to the ground station (server).

To start transfering files, follow the steps listed below:
1. enter "make" to create all executables (client,server)
2. enter "./server port_number", where port_number is a four digit port number greater than 6000.
3. on a new tab, enter "./client ip_address port_number", where ip_address is the IP Address of host(server). port_number is the same Port Number used by the server.
The server and client should now be connected. You may now choose from the following 3 commands:
4a. from the server, enter "new". This will send a request to the client, where you may enter a file to send; example: "star.jpg". The file should now be sent to the server. 
4b. enter "bye" from the server to shutdown only the client.
4c. enter "shutdown" to disconnect the socket and shutdown the server and client.
