This server client code is used to transfer images between the raspberry pi client in the plane and the server at the ground station
To start transfering the file, first type in command make to make sure all updates in the code is updated in the execution file
After make, start the server first before running the client
To start the server, simply run the server with a four digit port number greater than 6000, 
which will be the code for this specific connection, the format is ./server 9999
Then, to start a client that will connect to the server, the host name of the server need to be entered in the command line
For example, if using the EECS zuma server, the client execution command should be ./client zuma 9999
Notice that the port number and the host of the server must be correct for the connection to be successful
After connecting the server and the client, the server can send request to the client for certain action
For now, the implemented server requests are: pull, exit, shutdown
"pull" means to ask the client to send the target image file to the server
"bye" means to close the socket between the server and client, or, in other words, shutdown the client itself
"shutdown" means to close the socket first and then shutdown both the client and the server
